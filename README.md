## Introduction

Urban areas face challenges such as air pollution, heat island effect, and limited green spaces. Green roofs offer a solution by utilizing rooftop spaces to grow plants, reduce heat, and improve air quality. This project combines IoT sensors, data analytics, and microservices to create a system that monitors and optimizes green roof conditions.

## Features

- Collect real-time sensor data for temperature, humidity, light level, and soil moisture.
- Analyze sensor data to determine optimal conditions for plant growth.
- Provide insights and recommendations for maintaining green roofs.
- Enable remote monitoring and control through a web-based interface.
- Support data streaming, processing, and storage using Kafka and microservices architecture.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for microservices development.
- Kafka for data streaming and event-driven architecture.
- Redis for caching and data grid.
- Elasticsearch for non-relational data storage and search.
- Java Stream API for data processing.
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization.
- Eureka for service registration and discovery.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the necessary dependencies and tools (Java, Maven, Docker, etc.).
3. Build and deploy the microservices using Docker Compose.
4. Access the web-based interface to monitor and control green roof conditions.

## Usage

1. Start the Eureka Server for service discovery.
2. Run the microservices for sensor data collection, analysis, and storage.
3. Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the system.
4. Access the web interface to view real-time data and recommendations.
