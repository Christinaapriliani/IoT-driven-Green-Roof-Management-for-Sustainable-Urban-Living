This mini-project, "IoT-driven Green Roof Management for Sustainable Urban Living," will focus on managing and monitoring green roofs in urban environments using IoT technology. I will implement the components you mentioned to achieve this goal. 

Spring IoC: I am going to use Spring IoC to manage dependencies in our project. It's going to help in setting up the different components of our projects. 

Java Stream: I am going to use JavaScript to perform operations on data collected from sensors on the green roof. This will help with efficient and fast data processing. 

Advanced Native SQL Query: I'll use Advanced Native SQL Query to perform more complex data analysis and gain in-depth insights into the state of the roof garden. 

Containerization and Microservices: I will break down applications into several small services that can run in separate containers using containerization technology like Docker. Each service will be responsible for specific tasks in this project. 

Kafka and Stream-Based Application: I'll use Apache Kafka to build a streaming-based architecture. Data from the sensors will be sent through Kafka topics to be processed in real time. This will enable quick and responsive monitoring of changes in the green roof. 

Redis, Caching Strategy, and Data Grid: I will use Redis as a cache to store frequently accessed data. This will help reduce the load on the main database and speed up data access. 

Elastic and other non-relational databases: I am going to use Elastiksearch as a search database to store and index sensor data. This will allow users to quickly search and analyze historical data.
